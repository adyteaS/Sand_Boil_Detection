This is a repository of most of the code used for implementing my research work on the detection of sand boils from drone images.
This contains codes from the SVM, Stacking and Viola Jones parts of the paper.
The dataset and code in it's entirety can be found on http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software.html under "Detection of sand-boil".
